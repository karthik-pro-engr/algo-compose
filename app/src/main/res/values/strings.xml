<!--    Fuel Tank Balancer-->
    <string name="tp_fuel_title">Fuel Tank Balancer</string>
    <string name="tp_fuel_body">You are given a sequence of fuel events along a straight highway. Each event is an integer: a positive number means fuel is added at that station (refill), and a negative number means fuel is consumed to travel that segment (cost). Starting with 0 fuel at the first station of a considered stretch, the running fuel balance after visiting each successive station in the stretch must never become negative. \n\n
        Find the longest contiguous stretch (subarray) of stations such that, if you start at the first station of that stretch with zero fuel, the cumulative fuel balance remains ≥ 0 at every step inside the stretch. \n \n
        Return the length of that longest stretch and the positions (indices) of its first and last stations using 1-based indexing. If there is no non-empty valid stretch (i.e., every single-station start leads to immediate negative balance), return 0 -1 -1
